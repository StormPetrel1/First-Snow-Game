# First Snow Game

A short game I made in only 24 hours for an English project. Compiles/runs with the Love2D v11.5 framework. All art and music is completely original.

For instructions on how to download/play, see the [itch.io page](https://stormpetrel.itch.io/first-snow). For instructions on building the game from its source, see the [Love2D documentation](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution).
